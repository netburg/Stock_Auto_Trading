By working on the jobs that Forum assigned to me, I have:

1. Matered the credit risk quality control skills. As a quality control analyst at Natixis, I actively participated in the credit risk quality control process. 
2. Gained the ability to analyze the credit risk for a specific borrower. In my daily work, I have access to the risk analysis, training materials and conferences, through which I have learned how to find out the weakness of a borrower, to identify the regulatory issues, and to take actions to migate such risk.
3. Become proficient with Python, VBA and database. I was assigned to automate some Quality Control process using Python and VBA. In this project, I designed different tool that can be used for reading PDF files, parsing the system/website, and saving in our database. The team allows me to manage and maintain the QC database, which improved my financial engineering skills.

My work was recognized at Natixis and I received the offer so that I can continue to serve the company. My current employer, Forum, has supported me along the way.
